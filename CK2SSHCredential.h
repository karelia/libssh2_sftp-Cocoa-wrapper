 For general use, creates a credential backed by a keychain item
 When first requested, -password is cached. Its backing store is carefully managed to use keychain's cleanup routines when no longer in use
 Returns nil if username/account can't be retrieved from the keychain item
 
 @param user If you already know the user, can pass it in here to override whatever the keychain
 item reports. This seems to be needed on OS X 10.6 in some cases where apparently the keychain
 hands us an item with the correct password, but a different — nonsense — account name to the one we
 requested. https://karelia.fogbugz.com/f/cases/249308
